# Javascript-Design-Patterns
This is a repo containing code I write while working through "Learning Javascript Design Patterns" by Addy Osmani. The code here is mainly for personal reference, but will contain examples of many patterns I write while working through the book.
Here is a link to the book: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#factorypatternjavascript
